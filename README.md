This project was bootstrapped with [Create React AppComponent](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## To Run The Project

First run `yarn` to install the dependancies, then run `yarn start`.

Note: The react hook form devtools will be shown in development mode only and get removed in the production build. 

I wish I had had more time to hit more of the stretch goals (especially unit testing), but I have to cap the time put into any one tech challenge somewhere. Ask me to show you some of my `react-testing-library` examples if you would like. I have plenty of examples.
